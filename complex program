When you run the program, it greets you and waits for your input.

You type something like "hi," "how are you," or "what is your name."

The chatbot looks for keywords or phrases in your message using regular expressions (patterns).

If it finds a match, it replies with a random pre-set response from a list.

If it doesn't understand your input, it says:
"Sorry, I don't understand."

If you type "exit," "bye," or "quit," it says goodbye and stops running.
